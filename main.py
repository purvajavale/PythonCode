# When a Python interpreter reads a Python file, it first sets a few special variables.
# Then it executes the code from the file.
# One of those variables is called __name__.

# Python files are called modules, they are identified by the .py file extension.
# A module can define functions, classes, and variables.
# So when the interpreter runs a module,
# the __name__ variable will be set as  __main__ if the module that is being run is the main program.
# But if the code is importing the module from another module,
# then the __name__  variable will be set to that moduleâ€™s name.

# File two __name__ is set to: file_two
# File one __name__ is set to: __main__
